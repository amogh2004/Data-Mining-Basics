Data Mining Startoff Projects

1. Write a function col_stats(matrix). The function input is a matrix. The function should return the following statistics: sum, mean, and standard deviation of each column of the matrix. 
Write a test case by generating a random matrix from a standard normal distribution with size 10 x 10, and test run your function.

2. A prime number is a number that is only divisble by 1 and itself. </br>
  a. Write a function is_prime(number) that takes a number as an input and return True if the number is prime, False otherwise. </br>
  b. Write a function prime_list(number) that takes a number as input and return a list (or array) of all primes between 1 and that number. </br>
  c. Test your function prime_list() with number=10,000 or 100,000. What do you observe? </br>
